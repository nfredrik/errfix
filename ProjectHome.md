## About errfix ##
**errfix** is an easy to use Ruby API for modeling software. errfix enables you to easily create Finite State Machine (FSM) and Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) models of your software.

Model based testing with errfix allows you to reduce the maintenance of pre-defined test cases, by auto-generating Test-Walks through your system, and reporting on test coverage.

You no longer need to create lengthy, high maintenance test scripts. You can condense your systems behaviour into a simple state model and a few driver functions and let errfix create many of the context related test paths for you.

errfix allows you to define state machine models in it's easy to learn Ruby API or CSV files (either 1 or 2 dimensional State Tables). So you can create your state model in Microsoft Excel!

From these State Machines you can then:
  * Generate Random walks across your state model,
  * Report on state and transition coverage,
  * Create graphs of the model as [DOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language) files.



For examples of how to create simple models using the errfix DSL or CSV files read our [Wiki on the subject](http://code.google.com/p/errfix/wiki/errfixExamples).
